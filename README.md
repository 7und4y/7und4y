I genuinely do not care about people hiding behind me or cuddling, or any type of touch, as a matter of fact, I rather encourage it!  # If I'm not answering, it's either because I'm off tab (either searching for references or someone messaged me) or my social battery drained. Don't worry, I'll reboot after a few minutes. I'm very VERY chatty, so once you interact,,, ur poor social life is OVER! HA HA HA 
don't really care for shipping so if you interact with me for any shipping, ill be a lil nervous !! , I also am trash at roleplay (as in, I can't act out well of any character) ──── ✱.｡:｡✱.:｡✧*─── 𝖉𝖔 𝖓𝖔𝖙 𝖎𝖓𝖙𝖊𝖗𝖆𝖈𝖙 !! ───✱.｡:｡✱.:｡✧*.｡✰─── ₊˚ʚ ᗢ₊˚✧ ﾟ . proshippers.... you scare me fr...
